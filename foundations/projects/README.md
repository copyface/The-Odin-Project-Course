# 📚 Odin Projects Monorepo

## 🚀 Project Consolidation and Workflow
This repository serves as a single, organized collection (monorepo) for all completed projects from The Odin Project curriculum. This move was made to centralize the code and simplify my development workflow.

## ⚠️ Note on Commit History

- Older Projects: The original commit history has been reset. I cloned the final version of each older project and combined them, making the initial project code appear as one commit. This was done to avoid complex history merging.

- New Projects: All new projects developed in this monorepo will have a normal, complete commit history moving forward.
